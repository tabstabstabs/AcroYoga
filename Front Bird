		<p>This is the best pose to learn first!</p>
        <h2>Step by Step </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The flyer begins facing the base at the back of the mat</li>
                <li>The base places their feet on the flyer’s hips. *If the base has very tight hamstrings, they can place a blanket or bolster under their hips to give them more range of motion during your practice</li>
                <li>The flyer connects hands with the base and leans slightly forward to transfer their weight onto the base’s feet</li>
                <li>Be sure the flyer keeps their entire body fully engaged</li>
                <li>To come out of Front Bird Pose: the base slowly bends their knees to allow the flyer’s feet to connect with the mat</li>
            </ol>
